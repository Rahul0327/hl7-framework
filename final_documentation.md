## Introduction

Healthcare interoperability remains a significant challenge in the industry, with different systems using various standards and formats for data exchange. The HL7 framework provides standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information, but implementing these standards can be complex due to their diversity and evolution over time.

This master data model addresses these challenges by providing a unified approach that incorporates elements from multiple HL7 standards. It serves as a blueprint for designing healthcare information systems that can seamlessly exchange data with other systems, regardless of which specific HL7 standard they implement.

### Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this master data model is to:

- Provide a comprehensive framework for healthcare data representation aligned with HL7 standards
- Enable semantic interoperability between healthcare systems
- Support implementation of healthcare information systems that can exchange data across different standards
- Serve as a reference for mapping between different HL7 standards
- Facilitate compliance with healthcare interoperability requirements

The scope of the model includes:

- Patient demographic information
- Clinical data (observations, conditions, procedures, medications, etc.)
- Administrative data (encounters, appointments, etc.)
- Financial data (coverage, claims, etc.)
- Document management
- Terminology and code systems

### Intended Audience

This documentation is intended for:

- Healthcare IT architects and designers
- Software developers implementing healthcare systems
- Integration specialists working on healthcare interoperability
- Healthcare organizations planning to implement or upgrade their information systems
- Standards bodies and regulatory agencies

## HL7 Standards Overview

The HL7 framework encompasses multiple standards that have evolved over time to address different aspects of healthcare interoperability. The key standards incorporated in this master data model are:

### HL7 Version 2.x

HL7 v2.x is a messaging standard that defines how electronic data should be exchanged between different healthcare applications. It uses a non-XML encoding syntax based on segments and delimiters. Despite being one of the older standards, it remains widely implemented due to its flexibility and widespread adoption.

Key characteristics:
- Segment-based message structure (e.g., PID for patient identification, OBX for observations)
- Pipe-delimited format
- Support for various message types (ADT, ORM, ORU, etc.)
- Extensive optionality allowing for flexible implementation

### HL7 Version 3 and Reference Information Model (RIM)

HL7 v3 represents a significant departure from v2.x, using a formal methodology based on object-oriented principles. At its core is the Reference Information Model (RIM), which provides a coherent shared model between all the domains covered by HL7.

Key characteristics:
- XML-based format
- Based on the Reference Information Model (RIM)
- More rigorous and consistent than v2.x
- Stronger focus on semantic interoperability

### Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)

CDA is a document markup standard that specifies the structure and semantics of clinical documents for exchange. It is based on the HL7 v3 RIM and uses XML for encoding.

Key characteristics:
- Document-centric approach
- Combination of structured and unstructured content
- Human readability requirement
- Three levels of semantic interoperability (from unstructured to fully structured)

### Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)

FHIR is a next-generation standard designed to be easier to implement while addressing the shortcomings of previous standards. It combines the best features of HL7 v2.x, v3, and CDA while leveraging modern web technologies.

Key characteristics:
- Resource-based architecture
- RESTful API approach
- Support for JSON, XML, and RDF formats
- Built-in support for modern web technologies
- Focus on implementability and developer experience
